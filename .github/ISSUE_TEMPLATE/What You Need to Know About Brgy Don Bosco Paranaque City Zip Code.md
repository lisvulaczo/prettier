Brgy Don Bosco was established on April 3, 1978 by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 1322 issued by President Ferdinand E. Marcos. It was created by detaching and separating some subdivisions from Brgy La Huerta, which was one of the oldest barangays in Paranaque. The new barangay was named after Saint John Bosco, a Catholic priest and educator who founded the Salesian order and devoted his life to helping poor and abandoned children. [^1^]
 
The land of Brgy Don Bosco has a long and rich history that dates back to the Spanish colonial era. It was part of the missionary town founded by the Order of Saint Augustine in 1580, which included large agricultural landholdings from Malibay and Maricaban in the north to Las PiÃ±as in the south. The land was also annexed to the barrio of La Huerta, which had various sitios with names that reflected the local flora and fauna. [^2^]
 
During the American rule, many of the friar estates were purchased by the U.S. government under the Friar Lands Act and converted into military reservations or resold to tenant farmers. One of these estates was the Hacienda de Maricaban, which became a military airfield and reservation. Another estate was the ParaÃ±aque estate, which covered 129 hectares (320 acres) of land in present-day Brgy Don Bosco. The estate was acquired by the People's Homesite Corporation, a government housing agency, in 1959 through broker Julio T. de la Cruz who contacted individual owners who agreed to sell their land.
