## What is PROCART?
 
PROCART is the core functionality of PRO600. It lets you organize your MicroStation design files in a project-based manner by using a project management utility. PROCART also provides extensive feature-coding and cartographic presentation tools. You can set up default definitions for the various features you will collect in the project using a feature code library. The fully integrated collection modes allow you to easily create complex features. Several data editing and visualization tools complement those of MicroStation to help you generate the finished product[^1^].
 
## What is PRODTM?
 
PRODTM is an optional product that provides a variety of tools for terrain modeling. You can import terrain datasets into MicroStation design files, convert design files from 2-D to 3-D, and perform continuous interpolation from terrain data. PRODTM also allows you to merge MicroStation design file data into an IMAGINE Photogrammetry terrain dataset along with sophisticated breakline and polygon flattening features[^1^].
 
## Why use PRO600 for MicroStation V8i 111?
 
PRO600 for MicroStation V8i 111 is a powerful and versatile software that can help you create accurate and detailed photogrammetric maps and models. Some of the benefits of using PRO600 are:
 
- You can display imagery in both the Bentley product viewers and IMAGINE Photogrammetry Stereo-based viewers[^1^].
